    # Weird. --help doesn't work if other flags also specified.
    # E.g., this shows the help for usage:
    #   $ murano --help usage
    # but if a flag is added, the command gets run, e.g.,
    #   $ murano usage --ids 1234 --help
    # ignore the --help and runs the usage command.
    # ([lb] walked the code and it looks like when Commander tries to
    # validate the args, it doesn't like the --ids flag (maybe because
    # the "help" command is being used to validate?). Then it removes
    # the --ids flags (after --help was previously removed) and tries
    # the command *again* (in gems/commander-4.4.3/lib/commander/runner.rb,
    # look for the comment, "Remove the offending args and retry").
    #
    # 2017-06-14: [lb] tried override run! here to show help correctly
    # in this use case, but I could not get it to work. Oh, well... a
    # minor annoyance; just live with it, I guess.
